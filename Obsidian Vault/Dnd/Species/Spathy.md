# Description
Cowardly beetle people unable to be killed, only fearing the end of their long lifespans. The Spathy are a pathetic, sniveling people despite their resilience. Their entire society is built around fear of a god who’s name roughly approximates to “[[Hang Dog]]”. I mean that literally. The Spathy went from the Stone Age to the nuclear age in five seconds to destroy a giant creature they thought was [[Hang Dog]]. Now they roam the stars, staying out of the way, in search of the mythical “[[Brave One]]”: a messiah who will destroy [[Hang Dog]].
