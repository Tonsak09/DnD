# Description
Society of semi-humanoids with many aquatic or amphibious features Indicative of their evolutionary origins. Webbed fingers, translucent skin, gills which when on dry land fold up out of sight, some are even bioluminescent. In the last years, this society of knights have been letting out aggression equivalent to centuries worth of generational trauma. On their home planet, they were the bottom of the food chain. This led to stress, fear, anguish, and desperation among their people. Then they invented space ships. Things are different now. They fight the evils of the galaxy in an honor, combat, and feudal society. Activated ship weapons are a salute, not a threat, and duels are honorable.
