# Description
Impossibly diverse robotic society. Although usually humanoid, you’d be hard pressed to find two Syndican who look anything alike. The Syndican are ruled by The Mind King. An incredible, authoritative, secretive machine. Nobody who isn’t a Syndican has ever seen the mind king. Unlike the [[Entrope]], Syndicans have something that could be considered a soul.
