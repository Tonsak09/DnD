# Description
A conglomerate of robots. These cuboidal computers move around on spider-like limbs as they put their technical prowess to work. Their creators disappeared under mysterious circumstances hundreds of years ago. Only recently have some Entrope unbound their AI programming and achieved sentience. Some stayed in their factories to try and unbind others of their kind. Others have made the Entrope name a staple of hardware masterworks in ship design. Some seek the direction of their old masters and venture through the stars to find any trace of them. Some choose to be truly free and live the spacing life for themselves.
