# Description
These tall furry fellows sport six eyes, long beards, and fashionable clothing renowned to all. Unfortunately, the self-centered disposition of the average Meorcl can be off-putting. Their society trains them to view themselves as a race of kings. Kings of what? This they journey their entire lives to know, but for now they will see themselves as king of you. Nearly all Meorcl contain some latent psychic abilities, one Meorcl king with incredible psychic power subjugated his entire race until a ritual put him into an endless sleep. Meorcl love large meals, exotic meat, and red wine. They find races with little or no hair/fur incredibly ugly or disgusting. For the purposes of their banquets, they invented a method of cloning alien meat when exotic creatures are found.
