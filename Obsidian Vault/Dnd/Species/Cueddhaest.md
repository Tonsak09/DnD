# Description
Beings made of cosmic energy contained within strange bio mechanical suits which they grow using farms. These suits appear with reversed knees and a structure described as “like a pea pod with mantis arms and a paper plate mask”. Though this was not taken likely, it is strikingly accurate. This is one of the few resources they truly need. Cueddhaest cannot permanently die. If their shell is destroyed, and their energy is sufficiently dispersed to “destroy” them it will take approximately 40 years for them to reform. Cueddhaest can withstand the vacuum of space as can an undamaged shell. Cueddhaest are almost zealously worship the star father. Their history is rich with holy war and prophesy of their ascension to a higher form. They seek *three relics* crafted and hidden by ancient prophets who went their whole lives without shells. A Cueddhaest outside of its shell emits an energy signature of a small star and effects the world around it in a similar way. Cueddhaest always travel in pairs to achieve a balance in the influence of their twin doctrines. Though one may travel alone if it believes it is directed to by the [[Star Father]] or if its partner is discorporated.
