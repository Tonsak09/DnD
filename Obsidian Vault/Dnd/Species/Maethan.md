# Description
Moth-like humanoids and founders of the [[Central Curve]]: the largest business conglomerate in the entire galaxy. Originally prolific space pirates, the [[Maethan]] had the tech and the skills to rob a freighter blind in five minutes flat. After their plots to ambush warp gate traffic drew the attention of the interstellar community, the backlash forced them to learn an entirely new skill set very quickly. All out war. With their stolen technology and stealth, they put up an incredible fight. Eventually, enough of them got together that they could overcome any force. This standstill gave way to talking, trade, business, and eventually the [[Central Curve]]. Now they mix with the rest of the aliens despite their checkered past.
