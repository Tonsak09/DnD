# Description
These explorers have a long snake-like tail which is their preferred mode of transport, short legs, double jointed arms, and long ears all coated in a thin layer of fur. The Reeve, despite having existing settlements all across the galaxy, have not until recent years participated in space travel. Instead, they had opted for probes which sought out crashed [[Warp Gate]]s. Using these crashed gates, the Reeve were able to travel to faraway star systems without even lifting off. Though their techniques are outdated, not every Reeve can afford a space ship, so coordinates of these fallen gates fetch a pretty penny.
